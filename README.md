Muttagen
========

**This project is unfinished and abandoned.**

It is posted here in the hope that it might be useful. I wrote this to get an
email environment similar to Mutt in the Gmail web interface. At the time, this
was a solution to deal with IMAP, POP, and SMTP access being disabled. While
writing this, I discovered that it’s possible to download and send email using
the Gmail API, and am now using a collection of tools to do so, allowing me to
use Mutt once again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Greasemonkey user script to add [Mutt][1]-like features to Gmail. Hides
distracting UI elements and adds Mutt-like keyboard shortcuts.
